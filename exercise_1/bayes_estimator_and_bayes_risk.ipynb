    "# Exercise 1: Bayes Estimator and Bayes Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1 (M)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Propose a supervised learning setting: input space X, output space Y, a random variable (X,Y) with a joint distribution, and a loss function l(x,y). Compute the Bayes predictor $f^*$ : X → Y and the Bayes risk associated with this setting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Supervised Learning Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Input Space X:** The number of babies on an airline's planes over a 1-year period.\n",
    "    *   Units: Number of babies (dimensionless).\n",
    "    *   Distribution: We model $X$ as a Poisson random variable, $X \\sim \\mathcal{P}(\\lambda)$, with $\\lambda = 1,000,000$. The probability mass function is $P(X=x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^x}{x!}$ for $x = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Output Space Y:** The number of annoyed passengers.\n",
    "    *   Units: Number of annoyed passengers (dimensionless).\n",
    "    *   Conditional Distribution: Given $X=x$ (the number of babies), we model $Y$ as a Binomial random variable, $Y|X=x \\sim \\mathcal{B}(n_x, p)$.\n",
    "        *   $n_x = 10x$: The number of passengers considered \"exposed\" or \"nearby\" to babies is 10 times the number of babies.\n",
    "        *   $p = 0.4$: The probability that an \"exposed\" passenger becomes annoyed.\n",
    "    *   The probability mass function for $Y$ given $X=x$ is $P(Y=y|X=x) = \\binom{n_x}{y} p^y (1-p)^{n_x-y} = \\binom{10x}{y} (0.4)^y (0.6)^{10x-y}$ for $y = 0, 1, ..., 10x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Joint Distribution P(X,Y):**\n",
    "    *   $P(X=x, Y=y) = P(Y=y|X=x)P(X=x)$\n",
    "    *   $P(X=x, Y=y) = \\left(\\binom{10x}{y} (0.4)^y (0.6)^{10x-y}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^x}{x!}\\right)$\n",
    "    *   with $\\lambda = 10^6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Loss Function $l(y_{pred}, y_{actual})$:** We choose the squared loss function.\n",
    "    *   $l(y_{pred}, y_{actual}) = (y_{pred} - y_{actual})^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Bayes Predictor $f^*(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the squared loss function, the Bayes predictor $f^*(x)$ is the conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X=x$:\n",
    "$$f^*(x) = E[Y|X=x]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $X=x$, $Y$ follows a Binomial distribution $\\mathcal{B}(n_x, p)$ where $n_x = 10x$ and $p=0.4$.\n",
    "The expectation of a Binomial distribution $\\mathcal{B}(n,p)$ is $np$.\n",
    "Therefore,\n",
    "$$f^*(x) = n_x \\cdot p = (10x) \\cdot p$$\n",
    "Substituting $p=0.4$:\n",
    "$$f^*(x) = 10x \\cdot 0.4 = 4x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayes predictor is $f^*(x) = 4x$. This means the best prediction for the number of annoyed passengers is 4 times the number of babies observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Bayes Risk $R^*$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayes risk $R^*$ is the expected value of the loss function when using the Bayes predictor $f^*(X)$. For the squared loss, this is the expected squared error:\n",
    "$$R^* = \\mathbb{E}\\left[(f^*(X) - Y)^2\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which implies:\n",
    "$$R^* = \\mathbb{E}_X\\left[\\mathbb{E}_{Y|X}\\left[(f^*(X) - Y)^2 \\mid X\\right]\\right]$$\n",
    "But since $f^*(X) = \\mathbb{E}[Y|X]$, we have:\n",
    "$$R^* = \\mathbb{E}_X\\left[\\mathbb{E}_{Y|X}\\left[(\\mathbb{E}[Y|X] - Y)^2 \\mid X\\right]\\right]$$\n",
    "By the equality of the conditional variance:\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}_{Y|X}\\left[(\\mathbb{E}[Y|X] - Y)^2 \\mid X\\right] = \\mathbb{E}_{Y|X}\\left[(Y - \\mathbb{E}[Y|X])^2 \\mid X\\right] = \\operatorname{Var}(Y|X)$$\n",
    "So,\n",
    "$$R^* = \\mathbb{E}_X\\left[\\operatorname{Var}(Y|X)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a general result: **the Bayes risk for the squared loss is the expected conditional variance of $Y$ given $X$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for our specific model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $X=x$, $Y \\sim \\mathcal{B}(n_x, p)$ with $n_x = 10x$ and $p=0.4$.\n",
    "The variance of a Binomial distribution $\\mathcal{B}(n,p)$ is $np(1-p)$.\n",
    "So,\n",
    "$$\\operatorname{Var}(Y|X=x) = n_x \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p) = (10x) \\cdot 0.4 \\cdot 0.6 = 2.4x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we compute the expectation of this conditional variance over the distribution of $X$:\n",
    "$$R^* = \\mathbb{E}_X[2.4X] = 2.4 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[X]$$\n",
    "The expectation of a Poisson distribution $X \\sim \\mathcal{P}(\\lambda)$ is $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\lambda$.\n",
    "Given $\\lambda = 1,000,000$:\n",
    "$$R^* = 2.4 \\cdot \\lambda = 2.4 \\cdot 1,000,000 = 2,400,000$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion for Question 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Input Space X:** Number of babies, $X \\sim \\mathcal{P}(\\lambda=10^6)$.\n",
    "*   **Output Space Y:** Number of annoyed passengers. Conditional on $X=x$, $Y|X=x \\sim \\mathcal{B}(n_x=10x, p=0.4)$.\n",
