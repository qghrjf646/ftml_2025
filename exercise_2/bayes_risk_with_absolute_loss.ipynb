    "**Propose a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that has a zero derivative at some real value $x_0$, but $f(x_0)$ is not a local extremum of the function.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "    -x^2 & \\text{if } x < 0 \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us show that $f'(0) = 0$ but $f(0)$ is not a local extremum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The right-hand derivative at $x=0$ is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x - 0} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{x^2 - 0}{x} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x = 0\n",

    "Therefore, $f'(0) = 0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall the definition of the median:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The median $m$ of a real random variable $Y$ is any value such that $P(Y \\leq m) \\geq 0.5$ and $P(Y \\geq m) \\geq 0.5$.\n",
    "> For a continuous distribution, the median $m$ satisfies $F_Y(m) = 0.5$ where $F_Y$ is the cumulative distribution function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us show, with a concrete example, that the Bayes estimator for the squared loss (the conditional mean) is not, in general, optimal for the absolute loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Suppose $Y|X=x$ is a discrete random variable such that:\n",
    "- $P(Y=0|X=x) = 0.1$\n",
    "- $P(Y=1|X=x) = 0.9$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The conditional mean is:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  f^*_{\\text{squared}}(x) = \\mathbb{E}[Y|X=x] = 0 \\cdot 0.1 + 1 \\cdot 0.9 = 0.9\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- The conditional median is $1$ (since $P(Y < 1) = 0.1 < 0.5$ and $P(Y \\leq 1) = 1 \\geq 0.5$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, compute the absolute risk for both estimators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Risk for $f^*_{\\text{squared}}(x) = 0.9$:**\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}[|Y - 0.9|] = 0.1 \\cdot |0 - 0.9| + 0.9 \\cdot |1 - 0.9| = 0.1 \\cdot 0.9 + 0.9 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.18\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Risk for $h(x) = 1$ (the median):**\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}[|Y - 1|] = 0.1 \\cdot |0 - 1| + 0.9 \\cdot |1 - 1| = 0.1 \\cdot 1 + 0.9 \\cdot 0 = 0.1\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the estimator $h(x) = 1$ (the median) has a strictly smaller risk for the absolute loss than the mean $0.9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "This example shows that the Bayes estimator for the squared loss is not, in general, the Bayes estimator for the absolute loss.\n",
